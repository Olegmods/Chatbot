Demoniac gains 1 additional point with equal probability to any stat.

The numbers are relative, not absolute: if an Alchemist has 10 in Learning and 2 in Luck it means Learning is 5 times more likely to appear as a new skill in average. The same works when dealing with upgrades to the skill: if an Alchemist has only Luck and Learning on Basic or Advanced, he is 5 times more likely to level up Learning then Luck.

The game actually builds skill trees based on random seed that never changes during one game, so it is not actually possible to learn any skill on a level up - it is predetermined from the start of the game,
---
and can only be changed by learning a new skill from the Witch Hut, University, Scholar etc. However, a player cannot in any way know what will be offered (unless he is cheating), with a few exceptions (see below), so this is not a problem.

There are some coded level gains that work independently to the above probability tables:
- If a might hero OR AN ELEMENTALIST hasn't been offered a Magic school yet, he will be offered one on levels 4, 8, 12... (i.e. every four levels). If he gets offered a Magic school on one of other levels (according to the probability table above), the counter will be reset: e.g. if he is offered Magic school at level 3, it will be also offered on 7, 11, 15..., etc. unless the counter is reset.
- If a might hero OR AN ELEMENTALIST hasn't been offered Wisdom yet, it will be offered on levels 6, 12, 18... (i.e. every six levels). If the counter is reset it just restarts from the reset point.
- If a magic hero EXCEPT AN ELEMENTALIST hasn't been offered a Magic school yet, he will be offered one on levels 3, 6, 9... (i.e. every three levels). If he gets offered a Magic school on one of other levels (according to the probability table above), the counter will be reset: e.g. if he is offered Magic school at level 4, it will be also offered on 7, 10, 13..., etc. unless the counter is reset.
- If a magic hero EXCEPT AN ELEMENTALIST hasn't been offered Wisdom yet, it will be offered on levels 3, 6, 9... (i.e. every three levels). If the counter is reset it just restarts from the reset point.

The above is true when learning a Magic school/Wisdom, or improving the existing one.
If there is a conflict, and both Wisdom and Magic school are to appear according to the rule above, then Wisdom has the priority and will appear always.
You should always keep track which level up you are due to be offered a Magic school or Wisdom, in order to plan your hero development efficiently.

If a hero possesses a skill normally unattainable save if born with, or learned through Witch Hut and Scholar (e.g. Water Magic for Barbarians) then his chances of advancement in that skill will be the minimal possible (that is, they equal 1 according to the table above).

## Terrain movement costs

| Terrain type | no Pathfinding | Basic Pathfinding | Advanced Pathfinding | Expert Pathfinding |
|--------------|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
---
| | Straight | Diagonal | Straight | Diagonal | Straight | Diagonal | Straight | Diagonal |
|-----------------|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Cobblestone road | 50 | 71 | 50 | 71 | 50 | 71 | 50 | 71 |
| Gravel road | 65 | 92 | 65 | 92 | 65 | 92 | 65 | 92 |
| Dirt road | 75 | 106 | 75 | 106 | 75 | 106 | 75 | 106 |
| Dirt, Grass, Lava, Subterranean | 100 | 141 | 100 | 141 | 100 | 141 | 100 | 141 |
| Rough | 125 | 176 | 100 | 141 | 100 | 141 | 100 | 141 |
| Sand, Snow | 150 | 212 | 125 | 176 | 100 | 141 | 100 | 141 |
| Swamp | 175 | 247 | 150 | 212 | 125 | 176 | 100 | 141 |
| Favorable Winds | 66 | 93 | 66 | 93 | 66 | 93 | 66 | 93 |

There is one peculiarity: if the hero has at least 100 movement points left he will still be able to make a diagonal move on non penalty terrain. This is not true for penalty terrains, even in case you have native creatures or (any level of) Pathfinding.

Artifacts that increase movement (Boots of Speed, Equestrian's Gloves, Necklace of Ocean Guidance, Sea Captain's Hat) need only be worn at the end of the turn to gain bonus.

Boots of Speed increase land movement by +600.
Equestrian Gloves increase land movement by +300. Two pairs of Gloves do not work cumulatively.
Speed artifacts (such as Cape of Velocity) do not increase adventure map movement, but hero's creature specialty does. Sir Mullich's specialty does not, however.

If the hero is moving from one terrain type to another (potential) penalty is calculated based on the terrain from which he is moving into another. So, if you move from grass to swamp there is no penalty, but there is one if moving back to grass.
If a hero attacks a tile beside a wandering stack his movement will deduce based on the terrain from which he is moving into the attacked tile after winning. The same works if a hero is moving onto a map object: he will lose movement based on the tile in which he was standing just prior.
If the hero attacks a wandering stack directly (therefore not moving into the spot the wandering stack occupies) his movement will deduce based on the terrain from which he is attacking. The same works when hero is picking up resources.
In short: only the tile the hero is moving from counts.
However, there is an exception: if the hero moves to or from a road he will not gain any movement bonus. More so, if he steps from a penalty terrain onto the road, or vice versa, penalty will apply.

A hero can visit any movement providing map object as many times as he wants, as long as he fights between revisits.

The distance a hero travels depends on the creature's speed and artifacts at the beginning of the day, not on changes after the day starts. Snow/swamp/desert/rough terrain penalty is calculated for every tile traveled.

Default distance traveled by boat is 15 tiles and is not affected by creature speed. Each Lighthouse adds +500 to boat travel, but doesn't work until the next day after being flagged. Necklace of Ocean Guidance provides +1000, Sea Captain's Hat +500 movement points. Navigation skill provides +750 per level of skill.

Land and sea enchancing movement artifacts are a separate source, and are added to the Logistics and Navigation bonus, not enlarged by it. Same goes for movement enchancing objects.
---
Only a single Nomad must be present in your army (mixed or alone) to prevent movement penalty desert terrain.

If the army traverses a penalty associated terrain, and is composed of native and neutral units (Peasants, Mummies etc.), it can bypass the terrain penalty by placing all neutral units in left slots relative to the native units.

If the army avoids terrain penalty in any other way except through Pathfinding skill, it will never be able to avoid terrain penalty for the last movement tile.

Special terrain types: Cursed Ground, Magic Plains, Fiery Fields, Lucid Pools, Magic Clouds, Rocklands, Clover Field, Evil Fog and Holy Ground do not in any way affect hero movement. They represent a layer on top of the existing terrain, which may not at all be visible, but affects movement penalty calculations.

Town Portal doesn't work while hero is in a boat, while Dimension Door does (you cannot teleport out of water of course).

Town Portal costs 200 movement points if on Expert level, 300 otherwise.

Dimension Door costs 100 movement points, regardless of Air magic skill.

Fly (spell and artifact) isn't affected by terrain penalties but is by terrain bonuses (roads only). No Air magic Fly movement penalty is the same as Basic Air (140%).
Interesting fact is that penalties apply only if hero traverses terrain that would bear penalty normally. If the hero has the neccessary Pathfinding skill to nullify terrain penalty he doesn't even need to have Air magic, he will always fly full movement.
Angel Wings isn't affected by the above: it will always allow flying for full movement, other factors disregarded.

No Water magic Waterwalk penalty is the same as Basic Water (140%).
Boots of Levitation will always allow full levitating, no matter the school expertise.
Waterwalk (and Fly) is not affected by Favorable Winds.

## APPEARANCE OF MAP OBJECTS

Some (important) objects may appear only on certain terrain types. Those are marked for each terrain in the table:

| | Dirt | Grass | Lava | Rough | Sand | Snow | Subterranean | Swamp |
|---------------|------|-------|------|-------|------|------|---------------|-------|

## BATTLE PREFERENCES

Is it possible to know, looking at the 1st picture, which Pikemen stack will you engage? The rule is shown in the 2nd picture. The preference is always the creature to the left, and if they are aligned, the creature above. If you place the cursor directly over the creature then you will attack that creature: the mentioned is valid only if you place the cursor aside.

E.g. you need to fight Black Dragons or Giants to pass. Unfortunately, you can't attack the Giants directly, only Blacks, but you can attack the tile beside both of them. Using the rule above you may find a way to attack the Giants after all, in order to pass, or get the needed level up etc.

Map types by size (Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large) are 36², 72², 108² and 144² tiles large, or relatively, 6 : 25 : 56 : 100 (%).

If you retreat or surrender with the hero and rebuy him he will have the amount of movement points left when retreated/surrendered. Navigation (specialist) heroes can profit from this even more, for their naval movement points may be used for land movement when they retreat while in boat.

Sea Captain's Hat contains Summon Boat spell. With Advanced Water you can steal your opponent's boat.
---
Scholar preordained to give Basic skill will in fact give Advanced skill to a hero who already has Basic knowledge of the skill. Or Expert if he has Advanced, of course. And also, if a Scholar was preordained to give a secondary skill that the visiting hero doesn't have at all and that Hero has all 8 slots already full, then Scholar will give a +1 to a primary skill instead.

You can visit a Magic Spring twice in a row. The building is two tiles wide, just click on the other tile.

When visiting Sirens a hero will gain as much experience as HP sacrificed (30% of army). Although stated differently it is possible to visit the Sirens any number of times, provided a hero fought a battle, no matter the outcome, between visits.

Between turns you can check important wandering monsters on the map and remember their number (lots, horde etc.). If next week this changes you will know almost exactly how many monsters you will face.

When playing randoms, in general it is possible to guess the number of guards depending on what they are guarding. E.g. lots of Archers guarding an artifact and a Learning Stone are likely to be closer to 40 then 20 and so on.

You need to possess two Taverns to be able to see the size of stack guarding neutral towns (only descriptive). If you possess less you will only be able to see units' types.

If you are fighting any dwelling that provides artifacts, creatures, etc. and both yours and guardian creatures die you will need to revisit the dwelling, even start a combat against no one, to claim your award.

When invading a Pyramid a hero will learn the spell even if he doesn't possess Expert Wisdom, given that he acquires it post battle.

Rampart's Treasuries are cumulative.

If you possess at least one Crystal Dragon you receive 3 Crystal on Day 1.

Maximum possible level for any hero is 108.

You can check the number of guards in special buildings by right clicking them after you visited them (and refused to fight). You can never look at the number of guards in the Crypt, Derelict Ship and Shipwreck, all others are possible.

Abandoned mine can never be of Wood type. It is guarded by 100-249 Troglodytes.

Gold piles on the adventure map are always 500-1000, Wood/Ore 5-10, rest 3-6.

Windmill can never provide Wood.

Town and adventure map Taverns offer the same selection of heroes.

Two heroes of the same type can never appear at the same time in the Tavern except on Day 1 of the week. E.g. if you are looking for Tazar you must buy the Beastmaster offered, if any.

If you lose a hero it is always possible to rebuy him in the Tavern, but the chances to find him are slim. Your opponent may try this as well. In fact, the only heroes a player cannot buy on his turn are
---
the ones offered in other players' Taverns at the same time and those in game (including Prison heroes).

If the hero has the necessary prerequirements (Wisdom), he'll learn the spells he doesn't know by entering the town. You don't have to spend a turn in it, nor do you have to click on the Mage Guild. However, if you town portal your hero, make sure you see the town screen in order to learn spells.

If you carry two identical Legion artifacts the second one does nothing. But if you give one to another hero in the Garrison, both will work.

Creatures in external dwellings and Portal of Summoning still grow regardless of plague.

Each level of Diplomacy lets your hero enter the Library of Enlightment two levels earlier (normally level 10).

Every neutral town starts with level 1 and 2 buildings prebuilt.

It is possible to dismiss the hero in the Garrison by selecting it in Kingdom Review (e.g. you already have 8 heroes on the adventure map and so are not allowed to move him out of the Garrison).

## PORTAL OF SUMMONING
If you have only one external dwelling flagged you will always get creatures from that dwelling.
If you have more than 1 external dwelling flagged and then you build Portal of Summoning you will get a random creature on the day, and in next weeks.

## The cost of upgrading troops at a Hill Fort:
- Level 1: Free
- Level 2: 25% of normal cost
- Level 3: 50% of normal cost
- Level 4: 75% of normal cost
- Level 5: normal cost
- Level 6: normal cost
- Level 7: normal cost
Resources required for upgrading level 7 units are not affected, only Gold.

Any externall dwelling flagged, regardless of level, increases town production of the unit by 1. It is not affected by Citadel/Castle, Legion artifacts, but is by Grail structure (rounded down).
Creature growth works as such:
- Citadel and Castle affect base unit growth (without the Horde building)
- Horde building adds it's own bonus
- any externall dwellings provide additional +1 per dwelling
- Statue of Legion increases (Base unit growth + Citadel + Castle) by 50% in all towns
- Grail increases the sum of all above mentioned bonuses by 50% in the town installed
Calculations are rounded down.

If a hero retreats or is defeated only the surviving guards will be guarding the dwelling if another hero attacks in the same week. The guards will return to full force at the start of the week.

After a hero defeats dwelling guards the dwelling may be reflagged any number of times in that week by any other player without a fight. The guards will return at the start of the next week.
---
Any dwelling of level 1-4 may be flagged without fight. Level 5 are guarded by 9 (see exception in the paragraph below), level 6 by 6, and level 7-10 dwellings by 3 appropriate creatures (6 Firebirds are the exception). The creatures are always found in 1 stack.

Elemental Conflux is always guarded by 12 Earth Elementals. Flagging it will increase the growth of Air/Storm Elementals only.
Earth Elemental Conflux is also guarded by 12 creatures, the only violation of the rule in the paragraph above. Also, Earth Elemental Conflux provides 4 Elementals weekly, unlike all other level 5 dwellings (that provide 3).

Pyre dwelling provides 2 Firebirds weekly, unlike all other level 7 dwellings (that provide 1).

A hero will be able to cast a spell contained in an equipped Scroll regardless of whether or not he has the level of Wisdom skill normally needed to cast the spell in question. However, he must possess a Spell Book to be able to cast it.
Hero does not need to possess a Spell Book or Wisdom if he learns a spell from an artifact or by birth.

Dig holes along the coast to prevent that a boat can land there. If it's diagonal, you have to dig three holes.

Disguise does not work against AI.

Only these artifacts work cumulatively on the same hero, all others do not:
- All income artifacts (where it is possible to equip more then one of the same type)
- Quite Eye of the Dragon

You can build a town structure and then the Grail structure on the same day but not vice-versa.

If a hero with Grail in his backpack retreats, surrenders or loses a fight, the Grail will be lost.

Aurora Borealis will not teach visiting heroes spells of level 3-5 if they do not possess Wisdom.

Heroes without the Scouting skill and artifacts have a scouting range of 5.

External Stables automatically upgrades Cavaliers to Champions.

AI can still cast all spells (except those it never casts like Berserk) while standing on Cursed Ground.

Necropolis' Skeleton Transformer transforms Hydras and living Dragons to Bone Dragons. All other units are transformed to Skeletons.

Eagle Eye will allow you to learn spells from heroes only; you cannot learn spells from creatures.

If the Pandora's Box is guarded by level 6/7 creatures, try not to take it until you have Advanced/Expert Wisdom. Otherwise, if it's a spell inside, you gain nothing.

WEEK/MONTH EVENTS
Week events:
1. No growth weeks happen with 75% probability, while +5 growth weeks happen with 25% probability. As a consequence, there is a 0,2% probability for a specific creature +5 growth week (there are 126 possible creatures in total).
2. There can never be a double growth week.
---
3. There can never be a week of neutral creatures.

Month events:
1. No growth months happen with 50% probability, double growth monts happen with 40% probability, and plague months happen with 10% probability.
2. Only the following creatures may experience double growth:

| Fortress      | Tower      | Dungeon     |
|---------------|------------|-------------|
| Serpent Fly   | Gremlin    | Troglodyte  |
| Lizardman     | Hobgoblin  | Harpy       |
| Griffin       | Wolf Rider | Wight       |
| Centaur       | Gog        |             |
| Pegasus       | Imp        |             |

As a consequence, there is a 3,3% probability for a specific creature double growth month. The only exception to the rule is when Grail is built in an Inferno town: all the following months will be Imp double growth months.

3. There can never be a +5 growth month.

If you happen to get a Week/Month of unapgraded creatures whose dwelling you already upgraded in your town you will not receive a bonus.

Plague months have the following characteristics:
- All unpurchased creatures are cut in half, rounded down.
- All dwellings produce 0 creatures (exception below).
- Any dwelling which has horde building built is immune to the effects of plague. Thus a Castle with a Griffin Bastion produces Griffins normally. Similarly with Dwarves, Dendroids, Imps, Cerberi, Skeletons, Gnolls, etc.

## PHYSICAL DAMAGE CALCULATION

Total damage = Base damage * (1 + a + b + c + ...) * (1 - q) * (1 - r) * (1 - s) * ...

Base damage is damage displayed for every unit in its stats (e.g. 40-50 for a Black Dragon). For a stack of creatures it is calculated as such:
- If there are less then 10 creatures in a stack then a random integer is chosen in a damage range for each creature, and they are added up.
- If there are more than 10 creatures in a stack, 10 random integers are chosen in a damage range of the creature and added up. The result is multiplied by n/10, where n is the number of creatures in the stack, and rounded down.

The probability that the resulting base damage will be in the lowest/highest 25% is (approximately):
5.5% when the damage range contains 2 values
4.0% when the damage range contains 3 values
1.6% when the damage range contains 4 values
1.6% when the damage range contains 5 values
0.9% when the damage range contains 6 values

The decrease slows down quickly from now on. The probabilities only hold true if the attacking stack contains at least 10 creatures, otherwise they increase (to 25% in case there is only one creature in the stack).

a, b, c,... are damage bonuses, q, r, s,... are damage reductions (both as decimal numbers).

Damage cannot be reduced to less than 1 and is rounded down.

Damage Bonuses
---
| Attacker's Attack > Defender's Defense | 0,05 * (A - D), up to a maximum of 3 |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Attacker is a shooter | Archery skill bonus, additive with artifact bonuses if Archery skill present |
| Attacker is a Ballista, does double damage | 1 |
| Attacking hero has specialty Archery | 0,05 * Hero level * Archery bonus |
| Attacking hero has Offense | Offense skill bonus |
| Attacking hero has specialty Offense | 0,05 * Hero level * Offense bonus |
| Attacker gets Luck | 1 |
| Attacker is a Cavalier / Champion | 0,05 * hexes traveled |
| Attacker is an opposite Elemental type | 1 |
| Attacker 'hates' the Defender | 0,5 |
| Dread Knight's double damage | 1 |
| Bless specialty Hero, Bless is cast | 0,03 * Hero level / Unit level |

## Damage Reductions
| Defender's Defense > Attacker's Attack | 0,025 * (D – A), up to a maximum of 0,7 |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Defending hero has Armorer | Armorer skill bonus |
| Defending hero has specialty Armorer | 0,05 * Hero level *Armorer bonus, additive with base Armorer bonus |
| Defender has Shield spell applied | Shield spell bonus |
| Attacker is a shooter, Basic Air Shield is cast | 0,25 |
| Attacker is a shooter with range, wall or melee penalty, or Advanced Air Shield is cast | 0,5 |
| Attacking a petrified unit | 0,5 |
| Attacker is Psychic Elemental, defender is immune to Mind spells | 0,5 |
| Attacker is Magic Elemental, defender is Magic Elemental or the Black Dragon | 0,5 |
| Unit retaliates from Basic Blind state | 0,5 |
| Unit retaliates from Advanced Blind state | 0,25 |

Maximum Attack - Defense difference relevant for calculations is 60 (3 times the base damage).
Maximum Defense - Attack difference relevant for calculations is 28 (70% damage reduction).
Specialty in Armorer is additive with the base Armorer damage reduction (therefore has greater
effect). However, Shield bonus isn't additive but is multiplied normally with Armorer bonus.

Example: Level 18 Tazar with Expert Armorer and 12 Defense (normal distribution with no artifacts)
has a Chaos Hydra. Level 18 Gunnar with Expert Offense and 8 Attack (normal distribution with no
artifacts) has a Black Dragon. How much damage will a Black Dragon do?
Black Dragon's base damage = 40-50
Damage bonuses: 0,3 (Expert Offense), 0,05 (Attack – Defense difference)
Damage reductions: 0,285 (Expert Armorer and specialty)
Total damage = (40-50) * (1 + 0,3 + 0,05) * (1 - 0,285) = (40-50) * 1,35 * 0,715 = 38-48
If the Hydras had Expert Shield damage would have been 27-33.

## BALLISTA DAMAGE CALCULATION

Ballista damage = Base damage * (1 + a + b + c + ...) * (1 - q) * (1 - r) * (1 - s) * ...

Base damage is damage displayed in Ballista's stats. It is calculated as (2-3) * (Hero Attack + 1).
If Bless is applied it applies to base damage in total: it is wrong to change the base damage formula
to 4 * (Hero Attack + 1) for Advanced Bless. Base damage when blessed is simply calculated as:
---
3 * (Hero Attack + 1), + 1 if Advanced or Expert Bless is applied.

a, b, c,... are damage bonuses, q, r, s,... are damage reductions (both as decimal numbers). See chapter above for clarification.

Damage cannot be reduced to less than 1 and is rounded down.

If a hero has Ballista specialty he adds +1 to its Attack and Defense every 10 levels starting from level 5.

Theoretically, the most powerful Ballista hero is Orrin, but he overtakes Gurnisson too late for it to be noticeable. Ballista's usefulness rapidly drops as the game evolves and armies grow in numbers, which makes Gurnisson by far the most useful Ballista hero for he gets most from it from the start.

Example: A level 20 Gurnisson with 12 Attack (normal distribution with no artifacts), Expert Artillery and Expert Archery (but no artifacts) attacks a hero with Defense 12. No spells are cast, no range penalty, no Armorer. Ballista will deal (per shot):
Against Archangels (42 Defense): 41-61
Against Crusaders (24 Defense): 75-112
Against Marksmen (15 Defense): 88-132
If Ballista was blessed it would have dealt 63, 115, 135 damage.

## SPELL DAMAGE CALCULATION

Damage = (Base damage) * (1 + Sorcery + Sorcery special) * (1 + Orb) * (1 + Vulnerabilities)

All numbers are decimal.

Damage is rounded down.

Base damage is based on spell selected and hero's SP and Magic school expertise.

Sorcery is bonus based on expertise in the skill.

Sorcery specialty is bonus based on hero and unit level for heroes with Sorcery specialty.

Orb is bonus provided by the proper Orb.

Vulnerabilities are creature vulnerabilities to certain spells.

## HERO'S UNIT SPECIALTY

Unit specialties work for both unapgraded and upgraded units and for Ballista (which is treated as a level 5 unit):

Unit receives +1 speed immediately.

Unit's base Attack and Defense increase based on the following (independent of the above):
A/Dnew = RoundUp {A/Dbase * [1 + 0,05 * RoundDown (Hero level / Unit level)]}

The higher the level of the unit, lesser the bonus: level 1 unit specialist will approximately double his unit's stats at level 20, level 2 unit specialist at level 40, level 3 unit specialist at 60, etc. For example, the comparison between Stronghold unit specialty heroes at level 20:

| Hero     | Unit        | Base A/D of upgraded unit | Specialty bonus in A/D | Specialty bonus [%] |
|----------|-------------|---------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Gretchin | Goblins     | 5 3                       | 5 3                    | 100                 |
| Tyraxor  | Wolf Riders | 8 5                       | 4 3                    | 54                  |
| Jabarkas | Orcs        | 8 4                       | 3 2                    | 42                  |
| Krellion | Ogres       | 13 7                      | 4 2                    | 30                  |
| Shiva    | Rocs        | 13 11                     | 3 3                    | 25                  |
| Yog      | Cyclops     | 17 13                     | 3 2                    | 17                  |
---
This is true for all standardly playable heroes but Planeswalkers. For them it works differently:
Pasis and Monere: Magic/Psychic Elementals receive a permanent +3A, +3D
Thunar and Erdamon: Earth/Magma Elementals receive a permanent +2A, +1D, +5dmg
Ignissa and Fiur: Fire/Energy Elementals receive a permanent +1A, +1D, +2dmg
Lacus and Kalt: Water/Ice Elementals receive a permanent +2A

## HERO'S SECONDARY SKILL SPECIALTY

If the hero possesses a secondary skill specialty its bonus is calculated:
Hero level * 0,05 * Secondary skill bonus

The only exception is the Navigation skill bonus which is calculated with a 0,02 factor (multiplied with entire naval movement points).

The bonus is additive with base skill bonus.

## HERO'S SPELL SPECIALTY

This is true for all spell specialty heroes save Ciele and Luna, including Astral and Uland.
Hero's spell specialty bonus is calculated as:
(1 + Hero level * 0,03 / Unit level)

The bonus is additive with base spell damage.
The bonus is negligible against higher level units.

## PECULIAR HERO SPECIALTIES

Loynis' Prayer specialty gives an additional +3 speed, attack and defense to levels 1-2, +2 levels 3-4, +1 levels 5-6 and no bonuses to level 7.

Terek/Cyra/Brissa's Haste specialty gives an additional +3 speed to level 1-2, +2 levels 3-4, +1 levels 5-6 and no speed to level 7.

Coronius' Slayer specialty gives an additional +4 attack to level 1, +3 level 2, +2 level 3, +1 level 4, no attack to levels 5-6-7.

Zubin's Precision specialty gives an additional +3 attack to ranged levels 1-2, +2 levels 3-4, +1 levels 5-6, no attack to level 7.

Daremyth and Melodia's Fortune specialty enables them to cast a +3 Luck Fortune spell regardless of Air magic expertise.

Xsi, Darkstorn, Merist and Labetha's Stoneskin specialty gives an additional +3 defense to levels 1-2, +2 levels 3-4, +1 levels 5-6 and no defense to level 7.

Ash and Inteus' Bloodlust specialty gives an additional +3 attack to levels 1-2, +2 levels 3-4, +1 levels 5-6 and no attack to level 7.

Adela's Bless specialty adds BD * 0,03 * Hero level / Unit level damage to all units on top of the Bless spell. E.g., at level 18, Adela will provide (in average) 54% bonus damage to Halberdiers, 27% to Marksmen, 18% to Royal Griffins, 13,5% to Crusaders, 10,8% to Zealots, 9% to Champions, and 7,1% to Archangels.
---
Cuthbert, Mirlanda and Olema's Weakness specialty reduces attack by additional -3 vs. levels 1-2, -2 levels 3-4, -1 levels 5-6 and 0 vs. level 7.

Ciele Magic Arrow specialty increases Magic Arrow damage by 50%.

Luna's Firewall specialty doubles Firewall's damage.

## MORALE AND LUCK

| Morale/Luck | Probability |
|-------------|-------------|
| +1 morale / luck | 1/24 probability for double turn / damage. |
| +2 morale / luck | 1/12 probability for double turn / damage. |
| +3 morale / luck | 1/8 probability for double turn / damage. |
| -1 morale | 1/12 probability to lose a turn. |
| -2 morale | 1/6 probability to lose a turn. |
| -3 morale | 1/4 probability to lose a turn. |
| 0 (neutral) morale / luck | no probability of positive or negative morale, or luck. |

Negative luck cannot appear.

All units of the same town: +1 morale
(Arch)angel in army: +1 morale
Opponent has a Bone/Ghost Dragon: -1 morale
Necro unit in army: -1 morale
Two town's units in army: 0 morale
Three town's units in army: -1 morale
Four town's units in army: -2 morale
Five or more town's units in army: -3 morale
Sorrow modifies morale by -1/-2, based on Earth magic expertise.
Mirth modifies morale by +1/+2, based on Water magic expertise.

## NECROMANCY

Calculations are made using Necromancy skill before battle.
All Necromancy bonuses are cumulative.
The number of Skeletons raised from one killed stack is calculated as:
Necromancy * Stack's total HP / Skeleton's HP, up to maximum of creatures killed.
For Skeleton Warriors multiply with 2/3.
+Life artifacts do not affect Necromancy.
Necromancy skill is capped at 100%.

## JOINING

Hero strength = √ [(1 + 0,05 * Attack) * (1 + 0,05 * Defense)]

Army strength = sum of all creatures' AI values in hero's army

Total army strength = round down (Hero power * Army power)

Neutral's strength = sum of all neutral creatures' AI values

k = Total army strength / Neutrals' strength
---

## Strength factor (depends on k):
| k range       | Strength factor                   |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| k ≥ 7         | Strength factor = 11              |
| 1 ≤ k < 7     | Strength factor = round down [2 * (k – 1)] |
| 0,5 ≤ k < 1   | Strength factor = -1              |
| 0,333 ≤ k < 0,5 | Strength factor = -2            |
| k < 0,333     | Strength factor = -3              |

## Sympathy
| Value | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| 0     | There are no creatures of the same kind as neutrals in hero's army. This includes upgraded creatures as well, and works in both ways for all, except for Magma/Earth, Ice/Water and Energy/Fire Elementals. |
| 1     | There is at least one creature of the same kind as neutrals (including upgrades as in paragraph above) in hero's army. |
| 2     | Total number of creatures of the same kind as neutrals in hero's army (including upgrades as in paragraphs above) compromises more then 50% of the army. |

## Mood = level of aggression of neutral armies:
| Compliant | Friendly      | Aggressive     | Hostile        | Savage |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| -4        | Random 1 to 7 | Random 1 to 10 | Random 4 to 10 | 10     |
|           | In average 4  | In average 5,5 | In average 7   |        |

Charisma = Strength factor + Diplomacy level + Sympathy

1. If Mood > Charisma neutrals will fight.
2. If Charisma ≥ Mood:
   a) Neutrals will join for free if Sympathy + Diplomacy level + 1 ≥ Mood.
   b) If the above is not met, neutrals will join for money (resources are not required) if Sympathy + 2 * Diplomacy level + 1 ≥ Mood.
   c) If neither of the above is met neutrals will fight.
   If you reject the join offer from cases a) or b) neutrals will fight if Charisma = Mood or if they are preset to fight (possible on fixed maps only), otherwise they will flee.

E.g. probabilities for free and money join vs. hostile creatures (all creatures on random maps) are (in case Charisma ≥ Mood condition is met of course, otherwise they are 0%):

### Free join probabilities [%]
| Sympathy | None | Basic | Advanced | Expert |
|----------|------|-------|----------|--------|
| 0        | 0    | 0     | 0        | 14     |
| 1        | 0    | 0     | 14       | 29     |
| 2        | 0    | 14    | 29       | 43     |

### Money join probabilities [%]
| Sympathy | None | Basic | Advanced | Expert |
|----------|------|-------|----------|--------|
| 0        | 0    | 0     | 29       | 57     |
| 1        | 0    | 14    | 43       | 71     |
| 2        | 0    | 29    | 57       | 86     |

If the units are not willing to join, or you refuse (don't have enough) the join for money, you can still always fight them for experience.

Units will join for their purchase price, it cannot be modified.
---
Map tile is irrelevant when checking join probability.

If playing on Easy difficulty, hero's Diplomacy level is increased by 1 even if the hero does not possess the Diplomacy skill. Diplomacy level still cannot exceed 3 in total.

Selling scrolls can be extremely profitable: e.g. with 3 Marketplaces they go for 750 gold regardless of level. On randoms, where it is often easy to accumulate plenty of them, they alone can easily pay off Artifact Merchant investment.

## PHOENIX' REBIRTH SPECIALTY

A fraction of the total number of Phoenixes will be resurrected when the stack is destroyed once per battle; exact formula is 20% probability per Phoenix of reviving one Phoenix; i.e. 1 Phoenix grants a 20% probability to have 1 Phoenix revived, 4 Phoenixes grants an 80% probability to have one Phoenix revived, 5 Phoenixes automatically revives one Phoenix, 7 Phoenixes automatically brings one back to life with a 40% probability of reviving a 2nd.

# FAERIE DRAGON'S SPECIALTY

Each Faerie Dragon stack can cast up to 5 spells per combat. All spells are cast at Advanced expertise and with a Spell Power equaling five times the number of Dragons in the stack. Spells are chosen randomly.

| Spell           | Spell probability [%] | Spell damage                |
|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Ice Bolt        | 22                   | 20 + 100 * Faerie Dragons   |
| Lightning       | 22                   | 20 + 125 * Faerie Dragons   |
| Fireball        | 21                   | 30 + 50 * Faerie Dragons    |
| Magic Arrow     | 10                   | 20 + 50 * Faerie Dragons    |
| Frost Ring      | 10                   | 30 + 50 * Faerie Dragons    |
| Inferno         | 5                    | 40 + 50 * Faerie Dragons    |
| Meteor Shower   | 5                    | 50 + 125 * Faerie Dragons   |
| Chain Lightning | 5                    | 50 + 200 * Faerie Dragons   |

Magic Arrow can be cast in Anti-Magic Garrison, on Cursed Ground, and with Orb of Inhibition present.

All other spells can be cast in Anti-Magic Garrison (using F key) and with Orb of Inhibition present.
On Cursed Ground all spells except Magic Arrow either cannot be cast (target spells) or will not do any damage (area spells).

Faerie Dragons have a permanent Magic Mirror cast on themselves (with, likely, 30% deflection probability). It will reflect the hostile spell, but not if it was cast by the opponent's Faerie Dragon or if it is a mass or area spell. It will not reflect a hostile spell if there is no valid target for it in the opposing army (e.g. Blind if fighting Undead).

# PIT LORD'S SUMMON DEMON SPECIALTY

One Pit Lord raises 50 HP, which equals 10/7 Demons (1.42857).

The number of Demons raised is rounded down.

If there is insufficient HP in the dead stack, you will not use the ability up to its full potential. The easy way to calculate this is:
50 * Pit Lords ≥ HP destroyed.
If true, you will raise the maximum possible number of Demons.

Maximum number of Demons cannot exceed creatures lost, so you cannot revive more than 7 Demons from 7 Cavaliers for instance.

You can only raise living creatures.

Summon Demon is a level 2 spell.

Cloned Pit Lord stack can use the specialty as well.

+Life artifacts are helpful (you need less creatures to produce same results).

If there are no +Life artifacts present you need 8,75 times Imps compared to Pit Lords, 2,7 times Gogs or 1,4 times Hell Hounds to achieve maximum results. If the ratio is higher, surplus will go to waste.
The exact general info is shown in this table:

| Pit Lords | Raised Demons | Number of creatures required to raise the correspondent number of Demons based on creature's HP ||||||||||||||||||| |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|           |               | HP = 4                                                                                           | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10| 11| 12| 13| 14| 15| 16| 17| 18| 19| 20|

Every neutral town starts with level 1 and 2 buildings prebuilt. Those troops should be used for Demon farming if possible.

## RULES OF TURN ORDER

Every round is composed of four parts, in proper order:
1. Normal phase
2. War Machine phase
3. Morale phase
4. Wait phase

### NORMAL PHASE
Creatures play in decreasing order of speed.

If there is a speed tie among opposing units then player's A unit will play first if player's B unit has played just before and vice versa. Further turn order simply alternates between units of player's A and B (alternating rule).

This is true in all cases except the beginning of the 1st round where the attacker always plays first in case of a speed tie.

For all other rounds the rule holds: if A played last in previous round, B will play first in the next in case of a speed tie. War Machines are a factor in this case, even if they are not under player's control.

If there is a speed tie among units in the same army turn order is determined by left slot rule.
---

## WAR MACHINE PHASE
Ballistas always play before First Aid Tents (left slot rule). Ammo Carts are irrelevant.

If player's A unit has played just before then player's B Ballista will play first and vice versa.

If player possesses Artillery and/or First Aid skills he may wait with Ballista/First Aid Tent. Again the turn order simply alternates, for the wait part for War Machines follows immediately.

## MORALE PHASE
Units that receive morale in the normal phase and wait instead of acting play here, starting from the first unit that received morale. Turn order of this phase cannot be changed by any speed affecting spell.

## WAIT PHASE
Creatures play in increasing order of speed.

If there is a speed tie among opposing units then player's A unit will play first if player's B unit has played just before and vice versa. Further turn order simply alternates between units of player's A and B.

If there is a speed tie among units in the same army turn order is determined by left slot rule (so, not opposite, but the same as in normal phase).

## SPECIAL CASE: TOWN SIEGE WHEN FORT, CITADEL OR CASTLE BUILT
Turrets always play before the attacker's Catapult; Artillery and Ballistics skills are irrelevant.

If the Turret waits it will take its turn in War Machine phase.

If the Catapult waits it will take its turn in War Machine phase.

## PECULIARITIES
If the unit is unblinded/resurrected/unpetrified (no matter when it was blinded/killed/petrified) it will take it's turn as soon it is of highest speed if it is a normal phase, or of slowest speed if it is a wait phase. Alternating and left slot rule apply normally.

If a unit makes a move (or gets bad morale) and is killed and resurrected it will not play again in the same round.

Cloned unit will follow the alternating rule, but it will not follow the left slot rule: if there is a speed tie between 2 or more stacks in the same army, and Clone is cast on either of them, cloned stack will play after all other stacks have played.

## BATTLE PREPARATION

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO BEFORE THE START OF EVERY IMPORTANT BATTLE VS. HUMAN
- check his troop arrangement and answer properly with yours. E.g. if he has Mighty Gorgons on the left, and you know or suspect he will have a chance to hit your Behemoths because he has initiative, (mass) Haste or Tactics advantage, place your Behemoths on the right.
- use your advantages. E.g. Stronghold vs Stronghold where you have intiative, but do not know will you have Tactics advantage. If you plan to cast Mass Haste and attack immediately position your troops so that all can attack important target, like Ancient Behemoths. If you don't have all slots of relevant creatures full, split your Thunderbirds into 2 stacks, one with just 1 Thunderbird, so that 1 Thunderbird takes Behemoths retaliation. Then, if played right, you can continue with Thunderbirds, Ancient Behemoths and Wolf Riders on the Behemoths, giving you big edge in battle from the start.
- if you have Visions cast them: check the stats, morale, luck and mana. E.g. if he has 3 Luck and you have 1 but also possess the Hourglass of the Evil Hour, equip it. If you see he has neutral morale, but

all the same town units in army, it's almost certain he wears Spirit of Oppression. If he is low on mana, and is still going for you, you can suspect that he wears Recanter's Cloak or Orb of Inhibition. If you don't have Visions check the above at the start of the battle.

## WHEN THE BATTLE BEGINS
- check the speeds and hit points of all units.
- check for changes in morale and luck to discover the Hourglass of the Evil Hour and Spirit of Oppression.
- check for the presence of Orb of Inhibition and Recanter's Cloak by selecting (but not playing) a non mass spell of the appropriate level.
- check for the presence of any spell specific hindering artifacts (always check Berserk, Blind, (Chain) Lightning and Forgetfulness if they are important to you).
- check for the presence of the Sphere of Permanence when you're able, but only if you do not have Expert Water.
- check for the presence of the Badge of Courage by selecting (but not playing) a hostile Mind spell.
- check for the presence of Shackles of War.
- when you are able, calculate or determine does he have Armorer, Offense, Archery skills, Golden Bow, Bow of the Sharpshooter.

## DURING THE BATTLE
- you must always know the turn order one round in advance and be prepared for changes caused by spells.
- keep track of when every spell was cast and when will it expire.
- keep track of the damage caused by his spells to see are they enchanced and estimate his Magic school level based on damage of the spell cast (or other non damage, e.g. Resurrection).
- estimate his level in schools of magic based on spells he casts.
- keep track of yours and his mana pool.

## BATTLE TACTICS, INFO AND TIPS
A clever way to get creatures that outspeed you forward without waiting is to block your powerstack by single slow fodder units. The AI thinks you can't hit it, since your power stack is blocked and your fodder can't reach, and moves forward. Then you can move the fodder and smack it with your power stack. The AI doesn't seem to worry about whether its hit by a full shot or a half shot so your archers can benefit from this too.

If you are fighting some wandering Dendroids berserk one of the stacks and the two will bind each other forever, so that you can easily shoot them down.

Attacking an Elemental of the opposite type does twice the damage.

The only Elemental that flies is Energy Elemental.

Master Genie will always cast Magic Mirror on Gold Dragons.

Storm Elementals have melee penalty, although it is not mentioned in their stats.

Turrets aim mostly at shooters, so some fodder shooter stack can be used. If there are empty slots then you should divide the shooters (numbers are irrelevant), and the Turrets will not aim to maximize damage by shooting other stacks, but will shoot the shooter stack instead. Turrets have a priority to shoot lower stacks, so you should place shooter fodders all right in your hero screen army formation.
---
Turrets will always target clones as soon as possible.

If the opponent has Expert Tactics he can never deploy his shooter stack in a way to cover both opposite corners, you will always be able to place a 1-hex unit (only) in one of those corners, and it will receive half the damage.

There is a limit to the number of units on the battlefield, including summons, war machines, clones and dead troops, and it equals 20 for both sides. When the number reached it is not possible to clone, summon Demons/Elementals or resurrect dead stacks. In reality, this situation may occur only in Elemental fights.

## ARROW TURRETS
All towns' turrets do the same damage. If Fort, Citadel or Castle is built damage of the Middle turret is 15, and 7,5 for others.
Buildings increase turrets' damage, but only those buildings that are new in town view, not upgrades to the existing. So, every building save:
- dwellings' upgrades
- Mage Guild upgrades
- Horde buildings
- income upgrades
- some special ones
increases middle Turret damage by 3, and 1,5 for the other two.
Damage is almost always the maximum one (right click on the Turret), sometimes +1/2 points, and it does not depend on the target. Nothing can influence it, except the mentioned above (but it will be roughly double if the defender has Armorer or Air Shield).
Maximum damage for Castle, Conflux is 120, Necropolis, Inferno, Fortress 125, Stronghold, Turret, and Dungeon 130 (for all three Turrets).
Artillery allows the player to control the Turrets.

## CATAPULT AND BALLISTICS

| Ballistics level | Main Turret | Side Turrets | Gateway | Wall | 0 HP | 1 HP | 2 HP |
|------------------|-------------|--------------|---------|------|------|------|------|
| -                | 5%          | 10%          | 25%     | 50%  | 10%  | 60%  | 30%  |
| Bas              | 7%          | 15%          | 30%     | 60%  | 0%   | 50%  | 50%  |
| Adv              | 7%          | 15%          | 30%     | 60%  | 0%   | 50%  | 50%  |
| Exp              | 10%         | 20%          | 40%     | 75%  | 0%   | 0%   | 100% |

If the enemy has any troops that are native to the terrain all of the Quicksand pits/Land mines are visible to him.

You don't need to have Advanced Earth to be able to use the Resurrection properly. If you keep resurrecting your Angels (for instance) you will only loose the amount of Angels that u came into Utopia with compared to the lowest number they were during fight. I.e. if u have 5 Angels, loose 1, resurrect that one and loose it again and resurrect it again and use this tactic the entire battle you will only loose 1 Angel.

It is not always necessary to dispel or cure your blinded unit. There are other ways to unblind it, some of which are: Death Ripple, Meteor Shower, Inferno, Chain Lightning, Double breath attack etc.

Defending increases troop's Defense by 20% until the troop's next turn (even if blinded, extra defense will expire properly).
---
Thief in army enables the hero Expert Visions knowledge when right clicking.

The AI can retreat even if all of his stacks are blinded if he possesses a Ballista or First Aid Tent that has a unit to heal. AI can't retreat if he has Ammo Cart only. Artillery skill is irrelevant.

If you left click on your unit and then hover the cursor over the active spell you will see for how many more rounds will it last.

You can switch off Tactics. Use this to fool your opponent.

The number of stacks you will face depends on the strength of your army and the tile the battle takes place:

| Army's strength compared to enemy | Enemy stacks in battle based on tile type |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 0 – 50%                           | 7                 7               6      |
| 50 – 67%                          | 7                 6               5      |
| 67 – 100%                         | 6                 5               4      |
| 100 – 150%                        | 5                 4               3      |
| 150 – 200%                        | 4                 3               2      |
| > 200%                            | 3                 2               1      |

So, if you attack only with 1 fodder and see 6 stacks it means you are facing 3rd column formation, so you can calculate more precisely what you are going to face with your main army.

If a unit stands or dies on top of a dead unit, the latter's corpse cannot be used for any spell effect.

If there are no upgraded creatures, the rule for turn order of units in Imp Cache, Dwarven Treasury etc. is:

```
4    1
     5
3    2
```

If you destroy one of the stacks, e.g. stack 1, and retreat or lose, then one the next attack 2 will take the place of 1, 3 the place of 2 and so on, while 5 will remain empty.
There is a 50% probability for an upgraded stack to appear in Stores, Banks, Treasuries, Caches. It will always appear at position 3.

When you attack wandering troops there is 50% chance that one stack will be of upgraded type. Since stack number depends on armies' strength relation, it is not always wise to bring in everything with you into the fight. E.g. you fight 12 Reds. If they split into 7 stacks you will have to deal with only 2 Blacks, but if they split into two stacks you will deal with 6 Black Dragons.

Town's defending troops always has +1 A/D/speed bonus for fighting on native terrain, no matter the actual type of terrain the town is on. Attacker troops will receive the bonus if they are of the same type as the defending town.

You cannot open a town gate with a hypnotized unit.

AI will rather hit your Imps then your Gogs.

Pikemen and Halberdiers take no extra damage from Cavalry and Champion's jousting bonus.

Dread Knight has a 1/40 probability for a Lucky Double Strike when Luck = 3.
---
## MOAT
You only take damage when you go into, or end a turn in a moat. There is no way to avoid moat damage; no magic, immunity or resistance helps, except the following:
- Spell casters (or their clones) can cast and avoid damage,
- You can get bad morale,
- You can leave the moat.
- A unit teleported into the moat will not take damage (only via Teleport spell).
- Blinded unit will not take damage.
Hot moat types deal 90 damage (Fortress, Dungeon, Inferno), others 70.
Creatures in a moat take 10% extra physical damage if attacked.
Defending creatures are not immune to moat effects.

## TOWER LAND MINES
Tower Land Mines do 10 * SP + Adv Fire =10 * 10 + 50 = 150. They do more damage if hero's stats allow it. E.g. hero with SP 12 and Exp Fire will cause the mines to explode with 10 *12 + 100 = 220.
Mines' damage is affected by Orb of Tempestuous Fire (+50%).
Protection from Fire spell reduces damage appropriately, as does magic damage reduction of certain creatures.
Mines can be dispelled.
Creatures resistant or immune to Fire or level 3 spells are not affected.
Advanced Anti-magic and Recanter's Cloak grant immunity.
Allied creatures are always immune, no matter their alignment.
Only when a creature moves onto a mine or ends its turn there it explodes. Teleporting a unit onto it will not cause explosion. Arch Devils do not teleport in this sense.

It is impossible to fully destroy the upper and lower Turret. Units behind them always have 50% wall damage reduction.

The regeneration ability acquired through the Elixir of Life regenerates 50 HP when the stack gets its turn (if possible).

If there is a visiting hero and no hero inside Garrison armies are merged into the hero's army. What cannot be merged is unused. If attacked and the defender wins the battle, the unused Garrison armies are still there, if he loses, they're lost without fight.

Unlike the above, if you place troops in a mine, and position your hero on that mine, if attacked the armies will not join.

When an AI hero is coming, place a strong hero with an army able to beat the AI in the castle. Distribute the units - half of them in the town, half of them with the visiting hero. The AI will 'think' it has to do two fights and can win both of them. But what will happen is - your hero is placed in the town and there is only one fight. If setup properly the AI will be beaten.

Cyclops can attack fortifications with Basic Ballistics efficieny even if they are surrounded by adjacent enemy unit. Cyclops Kings shoot at Advanced Ballistics efficiency.

Placing a 2-hex unit in front of a beserked 1 or 2-hex creature will cause it to freeze, unless the berserked creature is within range of other potential targets. This is not the case in fight vs. human, only vs. neutrals.

If you are facing a big force (6 or 7 stacks) of 2-hex creatures and have Expert Earth magic a smart thing to do is to cast Force Field at the second row of the right. It will grow to the top of the map,
---
effectively blocking 2 or 3 stacks for two turns. They can't move because they need a 2 hexes hole to get through. An Expert Earth Force Field at both sides of an obstacle in the middle can block the entire enemy force from reaching your stacks.

Ballistae never run out of shots, although its stats say that it has 24.

## FORMATIONS

There are two types of formations: Loose and Tight. Troop arrangement depends on selected formation and number of stacks. For stacks 7, 6 and 1 arrangement is the same for both formations:

| 7 Stacks | 6 Stacks | 1 Stack |
|----------|----------|---------|
| 7 stacks formation | 6 stacks formation | 1 stack formation |

The images show troop formations on a hexagonal grid battlefield. The 7 stacks formation shows troops lined up vertically, occupying 7 hexes. The 6 stacks formation is similar but with 6 occupied hexes. The 1 stack formation shows a single unit in the center of the grid.

Loose formation for 5, 4, 3, 2 stacks:

[The image for loose formations is not provided in this screenshot, so I cannot describe it.]
---
Tight formation for 5, 4, 3, 2 stacks:

| 5 Stacks | 4 Stacks | 3 Stacks | 2 Stacks |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 5 stacks formation | 4 stacks formation | 3 stacks formation | 2 stacks formation |

| 5 Stacks | 4 Stacks | 3 Stacks | 2 Stacks |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 5 stacks formation | 4 stacks formation | 3 stacks formation | 2 stacks formation |

Note that only the order of creature stacks matters for determining their placement, not the actual army slots they occupy on the Hero Screen. Consider three stacks of creatures, say Gargoyles, Golems, and Mages, in this order from left to right as they appear on the hero screen. The Golems are always placed on the central map position, regardless of whether or not they occupy the central army slot. Likewise, the placement of the Gargoyles and the Mages (on neighboring or on remote positions) is determined only by the selected formation, not by the actual army slots they occupy.
---
You can't close the gate after something has fallen dead on it. You can't open a gate if something has fallen dead under it.

If a petrified unit gets morale you can still get a turn with it the same round if you cure or dispel it.

You can clone a stack standing in the moat, and the clone can appear in the moat without receiving damage.

AI controlled Harpy (Hags) will sometimes try to block shooters, including Ballistae or Catapults, without attacking them, and after they succeed in that will they begin attacking.

AI stacks will go for the nearest creature (that is out of reach) unless there is a ranged creature within 2 rounds movement.

AI will almost never wait if it can attack (it may wait in case it cannot avoid a friendly Firebreath, or in case of a massive retaliation etc). This is very useful in many cases, especially in the beginning of combat if you have Tactics.

If your shooter stack is not blocked AI will attack it if possible, unless there is another stack which he can attack and block the shooters (of course, it must not die or receive large damage from retaliation, among else. In general, AI will attack either the shooters or the meelers considering retaliation damage).

If you don't have Earth magic but win with only your resurrected stack on the field you get to keep one unit of the stack. If you win with more than one resurrected stack the most left slot resurrected stays post battle, others disappear.

In special locations (Utopias, Crypts, Stores etc.) your units will appear in 3 centered rows in this disposition (based on your unit's slots numbered from left to right on your hero's screen):
```
  1 2
3 4 5
  6 7
```
If you have less then 7 stacks, you will not occupy the higher numbers.

| Psychic Elemental does half damage to: | Magic Elemental does half damage to: |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Units immune/resistant to Mind spells | Black Dragon                        |
|                                       | Magic Elemental                     |

Send out waves of expendable heroes against a dangerous invader, each with 7*1 Wraith stacks, with the aim of reducing his spell points. You will need lots of extra gold of course to make this work. It is easily countered by Destroy Undead, except if you have the Pendant of Death. But even getting your enemy to cast Destroy Undead over and over is going to cause him to lose spell points.

You can block an open drawbridge with Force Field.

When all your creatures are dead your clones will disappear, but summoned Elementals will keep fighting to the end.

Breath attack works differently for the first hex and the second hex, damage is calculated separately (even base damage is rerolled) and Luck bonus applies for first hex only.
---
If you deal enough damage in a single blow to kill both the targeted Phoenixes stack and the one that would normally rise from their ashes, their Rebirth ability won't even happen at all.

If you have no other creatures/War Machines left standing, your stack of Phoenixes will have 0% chances at Rebirth (not the case for neutrals and AI). It is therefore prudent to try to kill the Phoenixes last.

Phoenix' Rebirth removes any spells affecting them (as does any resurrecting spell). The revived stack may receive good morale in the same turn (e.g. the Phoenix attacks, is killed by retaliating creature, is reborn, receives good morale).

If your Archangels, Archdevils or Ghost Dragons die in battle, their morale and luck specialties still work. Similar, even if you kill your opponent's Arch Mage, he will still pay -2 mana to cast spells, and if you kill your opponent's Silver Pegasi, you will still have to pay +2 mana to cast spells.

In a Utopia, the Dragons already have mixed alignment, so bringing a Ghost/Bone Dragon inside can cause them to freeze.

The Spirit of Oppression does not negate negative morale.

Minotaur (Kings) can never have less than +1 Morale, even with mixed town types or if Sorrow is cast, unless Spirit of Oppression is present.

Catapult is always (even with the Orb of Vulnerability present) immune to Implosion and Mind spells.

If you wait with Faerie Dragons their spell may change.

Harpies attacking Dendroids will get bound after they have returned to their original position.

By pressing the Autocombat key during the tactics phase AI will move your 2-hex creatures one step further (which he does regularly with his own troops).

A spell will affect a creature only if it creates a greenish outline on it.

Expert Earth Remove Obstacle spell can be used to search for Land Mines, and then canceled to save mana for more important things.

With Remove Obstacles you can destroy Land Mines, Firewalls and Force Fields. But you can't remove Walls or obstacles that cross the field.

Base price when surrendering is half the army's cost in gold. This can be further reduced via Diplomacy and Artifacts to a total of 5% of normal price.

Fights inside a Mine will always have subterranean battle terrain.

The entire underground will have a subterranean terrain in battle, regardless of what you see on the advanture map. But the movement penalties aren't affected.

These tips are perhaps mostly useful for Luna (Firewall spell), but work in general:
- Enemies in front of your unit will approach you directly.
- Enemies above your unit tend to walk down to one row above the unit before proceeding forward.
- Enemies below you rather walk forward and then upwards.
---
# SPELL TACTICS AND TIPS

Each time you cast Earthquake it does 1 damage to 4 different sections of the besieged town. However, Earthquake never hits the same section in the same cast twice, so, when you attack a town that has only a Fort you will break a wall in one cast because walls only have 1 HP. When you attack a town that has a Citadel/Castle built, it is still possible that a wall section falls down after you cast Earthquake only once, but only if the same section was also hit by your Catapult (or one of your Cyclopes) prior.

Land Mines affect only non native creatures, no matter the caster. You cannot even cast the spell if all the units involved are native to the terrain they fought on.

Resurrected previously fully dead stack is purged from all spells.

If a stack of casting creatures has already used all their casts, was fully killed and then resurrected, it will still not be able to cast.

For Resurrection (spell or Archangel's specialty) to work, it must be able to resurrect at least the number of HP of one killed creature. So, if you had 3 Azure Dragons, lost 1 and the second has 500 HP, you cannot resurrect if you have a 999 HP Resurrection, you need 1000 HP minimum, that is, 10 Archangels.

Ressurection and Animate Dead spells are of less value with +Life artifacts (less creatures are revived).

If you cast Prayer on an already Advanced Slowed creature, it adds only +2 speed, not +4. Therefore Prayer and Slow do not cancel each other, e.g. a Zealot of speed 7 when expert slowed will have speed 3, but only speed 5 if expert prayered.
So, speed of the creature both slowed and prayered is calculated:
rounddown(Base speed * Slow penalty) + rounddown(Prayer bonus * Slow penalty)
However, if u cast Haste or Cure next turn, the Prayer spell reveals its full potential and adds the missing +2 speed as well.

Disrupting Ray is undispellable by anything; it lasts as long as the affected stack does.

Titan's Thunder special lightning spell can only be enhanced by an Orb of Firmament and/or Sorcery secondary skill and specialty. Nothing else enhances the spell, but creature vulnerabilities do apply: Air and Storm Elementals receive twice the damage.
It is a level 5 spell.
When equipped it permanently adds a Spell Book if the hero does not possess one (you may remove it afterwards).

You cannot resurrect Gold Dragons with Sacrifice because the resurrecting part is a level 4 spell.

Counterstrike, even if dispelled, will continue to work until the end of the round.

Teleport is the only spell that gets cheaper with the Advanced and Expert skill as well. Normally it costs 15 spell points, with Basic Water magic 12, with Advanced 6 and with Expert 3. And if you have Magi among your troops you can get it to 1.
---
Advanced Forgetfulness is a mass spell (bug). Also, Forgetfulness adds melee penalty to shooters that do not have one.

Hypnotized creatures' special abilities still work.

Curse spell description incorrectly states that it reduces base damage to:
[(80% of minimum damage) – 1]. It actually reduces it to (minimum damage - 1), down to a minimum of 1.

## FORCE FIELD
It lasts only 2 rounds always, regardless of SP and Earth magic expertise. On Advanced it becomes 3-hex long making it possible to protect a 2-hex unit from other 2-hex units on the attacker's side of the field.

## FRENZY
Lasts right until the targeted unit's second turn from now. Even if the unit is blinded while frenzied the spell will still expire properly.

## DISPEL
No creature is immune to Dispel. It can be prevented only with the Orb of Permanence of the Power of the Dragon Father.
It is always possible to terminate spells on own units, Water school not being a factor.
It is not possible at all to dispel any spell on enemy units with Basic Dispel.
Advanced Dispel on the other hand terminates any spell, of any level and expertise, on any creature.
The only spell being the exception is Disrupting Ray.
The only creature spell/ability being the exception is Wyvern Monarch's Poison.

## CURE
It is always possible to terminate hostile spells on own units, Water school not being a factor.
The only spell being the exception is Disrupting Ray.
The only creature spell/ability being the exception is Dendroid's Binding.

## CLONE
You can't have more than one clone at a time for any given stack of creatures.
Clones have exactly the same special abilities as their originals (whatever stack a Ghost Dragon Clone ages will remain aged even after the clone disappeares, and so on). There is one exception: an Efreeti Sultan's clone will not appear with Fire Shield.
Clones are immune to the retaliatory damage of Fire Shield.
Shooter clones will always be cast with maximum number of shots.
Clones are affected by hero's skills, stats, morale (if applicable), luck and artifacts just like the original creatures.
A clone won't appear with any spell on it, neither beneficial nor negative.
A clone will always appear at full health.
All spells applicable to a creature will work fine on its clone except Anti-magic, Animate Dead, Resurrect, Sacrifice and Clone.
Opponent's clones do not count for experience.
Opponent's clones do count for necromancy calculations, but only up to one clone for each stack.
Necromancy will also be calculated in case the clone remains as the last unit in opponent's army and if the original unit is killed (therefore terminating the clone), but will not be calculated if clone disappears for SP (duration) reasons.
Clone lasts as many rounds as caster's SP or until the original unit is killed.
You can clone level 8-10 units with Expert Water Clone.
---
If you cast Clone and there is no space to place the cloned stack, clone will not appear and the original stack will disappear if taken damage because it became its own clone.

## BERSERK

Sometimes the unit doesn't move at all, even if another unit is next to it. If that happens, it is still beserked the next round.

If there are no units within range, sometimes the beserked unit moves toward another unit, sometimes it doesn't.

Sometimes the unit will move toward another unit one round, but not the next.

When the unit doesn't move, the text box doesn't show it defended or waited either one. It doesn't show anything at all for that unit.

One time the unit didn't move and nothing showed in the text box. But the unit got morale which did show in the text box saying '.......attacks again'. But the unit just stood there and nothing else showed in the text box (and they remained beserked).

When they don't move, they do not get the 20% defense bonus like they would when defending.

The berserk spell doesn't expire (or at least it lasts longer than 1 round per Spell Power).

## IMMUNITIES AND RESISTANCES. UNITS' ABILITIES

If player A has the Orb of Vulnerability all resistances are negated when player A casts spells. When player B casts spells only troops that player A owns lose their resistances.

The Orb does not affect damage reductions that some creatures have (e.g. Titans still take half damage from Psychic Elementals and Golems still retain spell damage reduction).

Spells Anti-Magic and Protection from provide protrction with Orb present.

Immunities are bolded and are not negated by Orb of Vulnerability; resistances, however, are. If the resistance percentage is unmentioned it is 100%.

Some creature abilities cannot be resisted by any creature, and are not mentioned individually for each creature: see section's bottom for the list.

## EFREET SULTAN'S FIRE SHIELD

Instant resolving ability. Level 4. 100% appliance probability.

Immunity: Efreet/Efreet Sultans, Fire/Energy Elementals, Firebirds/Phoenix, Clones

Equivalent to Basic Fire Fire Shield spell.

Damage to Golems is reduced according to the Golem type's spell damage reduction. Protection from Fire will also reduce the damage.

If the hero casts Fire Shield on a stack of Efreet Sultans the two Fire Shields do not both apply; you don't get two shields, the spell remains.

The damage of the Fire Shield is (Base damage) * [1 + ∑ (Additional damage)], i.e. the damage that would be done if there were no damage reductions. Notice that this seriously hurts units with melee penalty since they'll deal half damage, so the Fire Shield returns a much larger percentage of the damage that was delivered.

## 2-HEX ATTACK
Firebirds/Phoenixes and all Dragons save Crystal and Faerie have the property to attack two units in one attack if adjacent.
---
In the beginning of battle, when all creatures stand on their starting positions, the attacker cannot evoke opponent's Dragon Fire Breath attack on a friendly unit if attacking with a 2-hex unit, but can with 1-hex. Defender may use both 1-hex and 2-hex units for this purpose.

The configurations where the attacker is placed below the Dragon or the Dragon (Dragon meaning a 2-hex attack creature from now on) is facing the other side are of course the same, just flip the above images accordingly.

## RULES OF HITTING TWO STACKS WITH A 2-HEX ATTACK

```
    7   8       9
      \ | \   / |
        |   X   |
4 ------| H |------6
        |   X   |
      / | /   \ |
    1   2       3
```

Green arrows indicate that the Dragon will turn around when it attacks/retaliates in the given direction. Otherwise the Dragon won't turn around. No other attack directions are possible without moving the Dragon.

There is one exception: If the Dragon attacks a 2-hex creature in the directions 2 or 8 (like the numpad) which also occupies one of the hexes marked with an X it will instead attack in the directions 3 or 9 respectively.

## RULES OF EVOKING AN OPPONENT'S UNIT 2-HEX ATTACK AGAINST A FRIENDLY CREATURE

```
      \ | \   / |
        | H |
      / | /   \ |
```

The next one shows how a Dragon will retaliate depending on the direction and hex from which it is attacked.
Again, green arrows indicate that the Dragon will turn around.

There is however one special case that cannot be treated like this. It is shown below:

```
    \   /
      X
    H
```
---
The attacker attacks the Dragon along the green arrow. If it's a 2-hex unit it will also occupy the hex marked with an X. In that case the Dragon will retaliate along the blue arrow. If the attacker is a 1-hex unit it will retaliate along the purple arrow (since the direction of the blue arrow would be absurd).

## SPECIFIC BATTLE TACTICS

### LUNA'S FIREWALL TACTICS

Luna is an extremely powerful hero in certain situations. Her Firewall does 20 * SP + 100 with Expert Fire expertise, and can easily take any Naga Bank or Griffin Conservatory very early - usually beginning of week 2 - with sufficient SP. No other hero in the game can do this as close as effectively, with Hack coming second.

### GRIFFIN CONSERVATORY

When you place a 3-hex-Firewall against the left side of the battle field, leaving only one space for your fast 1-hex-troop (which should be your only troop unless the opponent can get morale, in that case you should always split to 3 stacks at least), Griffins will ALWAYS defend (this is valid for all situations). Next turn place a second Firewall next to the first one. Now the Griffins will fly into two Firewalls.

It is possible to take a full Griffin Conservatory w2d1 with no other spells. You will need to bring in a stack ofcreatures (like Efreeti, Magic Elementals or similar), fodder isn't enough. Also, you must have the initiative (beware of Royals). If you have SP 11 or more you may lose 1 level 6 unit, if you have Cure, likely none.

### NAGA BANK

Nagas (and Queens) have 110 HP, so, in a full Bank, you need to be able to kill 330 HP with one Firewall, which equals 12 SP. If you have this and the initiative you do not need to fear morale at all, but, if you don't, you cannot simply enter with fodder, for 1 Naga will survive, and may get morale, so loses can be serious.

Other, Imp Caches and Dwarven Treasuries are much easier: you need 7 SP Firewall for full Cache, and 10 SP for a full Treasury.

Dragon Fly Hives are more difficult, mostly because of the initiative. If you can get that you need to kill 360 HP, for you are dealing with 1-hex units, which equals SP 13.

Never fight Pit Lords. As soon as any stack of them dies, another will resurrect it and the resultant Demon stack will be able to attack you before the Firewall damages it. If you attack Pit Fiends always kill the Pit Lord stack first for the same reason.

If an enemy stack is currently on a row beneath or above the Firewall and could manage to attack you from behind (based on its movement), it usually will by using most of its mobility to move forward, with his last hex of movement to be to close in on you just behind the Firewall. To avoid this sometimes you might need to count out their mobility to make sure that their last hex of movement is spent closing in on you on the Firewall.

### BLIND TRICK

Winning a fight such as the one shown is done by casting Blind on any opposing stack and moving Hydras next to it. Your Hydras will never be attacked in that position for their retaliation would strike the blinded creature, which the AI will avoid at all costs. You need to wait out the Mighty Gorgons, strike and return next to the blinded stack. You do not even need that much mana, as shown.
---
The only problem may arise when you wait turn 1 if Gorgons get morale. This can be avoided by Mass Slow or Spirit of Oppression for instance.

Also, do not blind the same stack always: you need to attrition them so that you don't take on a 25 Gorgon stack last, that can easily kill 2 of your Hydras. If you have Expert Fire Blind this is less important (but is very unlikely to happen with Fortress armies).

Bless helps a lot if you are low on mana.

The same general strategy applies to Magic and Psychic Elementals.

[The image shows a game screen with a hexagonal grid battlefield. On the left side is a single creature (possibly a Hydra), and on the right side are six stacks of creatures (possibly Magogs). The battlefield is set in a forested area.]

## 1 ANGEL VS 250 MAGOGS

This is the variation of the above.

Hero's skills are 8/8/5/5.

You must be able to block 2 Magog stacks immidiatelly.

Cast Shield immediately.

Cure when needed.

Always position the Angel between 2 stacks and always attack the lower one so that you retaliate to the upper one and attrition them steadily. It is an analogy to the above: the AI will not attack if it will damage itself, Dragons being an exception. Therefore Magogs will not fire for they would kill their own.

There's a forested background, and the bottom of the screen shows action buttons including "NEXT CREATURE" and "START COMBAT".

Below the image, the document provides strategic information about the game:

## FULL CRYPT

Your troops will appear as (depending on the slot placement):
```
  1 2
3 4 5
  6 7
```

If you are not fighting on Dirt Vampires can reach your stacks 1 and 3. If you are fighting on Dirt Vampires can also reach 4 and 6. So NEVER place important stacks there. If you have a good shooter stack (Marksmen, Elves etc.) and a big melee stack (the latter is a must ofcourse) the ideal placement of your troops is mostly shooters on 5 and meelers on 2. You want the Vampires to attack 1 if they have the speed advantage so make sure it has more HP than 3. Your goal is to kill the Skeleton stack in one blow (or nearly) with your meelers and to move your shooters up right (if you don't have a speed advantage over Vampires).

Towns that can safely do it Day 1 are Rampart (Grand Elves, even Elves with the speed advantage or Haste/Slow), Castle (Marksmen, Archers likely mean some loses if you don't have plenty), Dungeon (Shakti, Bless, Slow or Haste are helpful), Conflux (Sprites are great, and it's a piece of cake with Bless). With Tower you can try only with a speed advantage, Stronghold's best bet is probably a large Hobgoblin stack, Fortess, Necropolis and Inferno are not recommended. Keep in mind that Crypts can't appear on Rough and Lava, so you probably won't have any dealings with this issue if playing Stronghold or Inferno.

## CASTLE

Worst case scenario would probably be no Archer's Tower built, very low Archer numbers (4 – 10). In this case you don't wont your Archers in anyway, but you do want a big fodder stack, and you could really use a Bless spell (Mage Guild is usually a Day 1 build because you are going for the Angels). You
---
could arrange your troops like this (fight is on grass so that Pikemen have speed 5. You will loose troops if you don't have the +1 speed bonus):

1. 2 fodder (just make sure it has more HP than 3)
2. Big stack fodder
3. 1 Pikeman (to act before Wights do)
4. All Pikemen
5. 1 fodder
6. 1 fodder
7. 1 fodder

Vampires will kill 1, now 3 attacks them to take up the retaliation (on grass Pikemen have speed 5 like Wights and 3 will go first because of the alternating rule). Wights kill 6, 4 (blessed if possible) attack Vampires. Skeletons and 2 should do their own fight, 5 and 7 move towards Wights. Walking Undead probably move up towards 2. End of first round. Vampires will be dead round 2, Wights will last 2 more rounds. 2 should have killed the Skeletons (or at least most of them). So from round 5 you have about 45 Pikemen fighting against 20 Walking Undead.

If you have a reasonable Archer stack (12+) your goal would be to move with them to the Skeletons' positions (look at the general rules).

If you have a single Angel (e.g. it is your scout doing fights) you should attack Wights turn 1, then Skeletons turn 2. Do not attack the Vampires turn 1.

## RAMPART

If you take Ivor and get a good number of Elves it is an easy fight on grass (even on neutral) Day 1, you don't need a big fodder stack or the Dwarves. Just follow the general tips. If you get just 7-8 Elves, <40 Centaurs and a fodder stack you will probably sustain loses.

## NECROPOLIS

Very tough if you don't go with Galthran. Get a Mage Guild first too. If you get Haste it becomes easy. Arrange as such:

1. 3-4 non Necro level 1
2. Zombies
3. 2 Skeletons
4. 1 Skeleton
5. All Skeletons
6. 1 Skeleton
7. 1 Skeleton

Vampires kill 1. 3 moves towards Wights, Wights kill it. 4 soaks Vampires' retaliation. 5 hits Vampires. 6 moves towards Wights to take their hit on turn 2. 7 sticks around the middle (used when needed). 2 hits Vampires. End of round 1. Vampires will probably hit 2, but since they are a no retaliation unit it is hard to predict anything. Hasting your Skeletons round 1 works best, if you don't have Haste Slow the Vampires down, if you don't have Slow, cast Shield on Skeletons, or cast a Magic Arrow on the Vampires. 5 finishes off Vampires, 6 gets killed by Wights, 7 sticks around, trying to avoid getting killed. 2 is fiercely fighting the Skeleton stack. You can Shield them in the beginning of the round to help keep them alive. End of round 2. At this point you have Wights in the bottom right corner, nearly dead Skeleton stack, and an enemy 20 Zombie stack to deal with. Use the big Skeleton stack, Zombie stack, 1 Skeleton stack to win with minimal Skeleton losses.

## FORTRESS

Drakon and Bron are your best bet. Lizards aren't of that much use.

1. fodder (make sure it has more HP than 3)
2. big fodder stack
---

```
3 1 Gnoll
4 All Gnolls
5 1 fodder
6 1 Serpent Fly
7 1 fodder
```

6 attacks Vampires. Vampires attack 1. 4 attacks Vampires (should deal up to 150 damage). 3 moves to the corner next to the Wights. 2 attacks Vampires. End of round 1. Since your Serpent Fly is now dead your Gnolls get a strike on the Vampires, leaving 2 at most.

## DUNGEON

If playing Shakti and having a large stack of Troglodytes, Infernal Troglodytes will still be slower (on randoms) then the Vampires in Crypts for you start on Dirt. Therefore, place the Troglodytes on position 2, so that you are safe from Wights as well. If you have a +1 speed artifact then you mayplace them on 1 and kill Vamps turn 1, but you will likely need Bless.

## MEDUSA STORES

### CASTLE

Your main disadvantage here is that Pikemen are only of speed 4, you can't use them as single speed blockers. Use any other unit that has speed 6 or more, Gargoyles, Harpies, Griffins etc.

Never try to block the Medusas and use your Marksmen, they will move towards them and you are dead.

This means there are two options with Castle to take the Stores, and that is if you built Cavaliers or Angels week 1.

### RAMPART

Unicorns and Centaurs are perfect, just be careful with Elves for the case Medusas get morale. You will need to go for the stack that is closest to your Elves with your tank stacks, and than you hope that none of the blocked Medusas shoot at the Elves.

### TOWER

Nagas can kill everything and your Master Gremlins should kill 1 whole stack too. Gargoyles are perfect blockers. Try to aim to have Haste ready for the Nagas (not required for Naga Queens), or you may be too slow in the end.

If u split the Naga Queens in 5 you can use your Master Gremlins to take out any Medusa stack which gets morale or stones the Naga Queen.

You can also split the Queens in 2 and 3 (make sure 3 go down to confront Medusa Queens). You want it look like this (make sure to place Gargoyles exactly as such, you want Medusas to enter the Queens' range when killing 2 Gargoyles).
---
The image shows a game board from what appears to be a strategy game, likely Heroes of Might and Magic. The board is a hexagonal grid set on a grassy field with a forest in the background. Various fantasy creatures and characters are positioned on the grid, including what look like knights, dragons, and magical beings. Below the game board image is text providing strategy advice for different factions in the game.

## FORTRESS
Stay away from the Stores, Wyverns are weak, Gnolls are slow, and more often that not you will not have many other options.

If the Stores are at swamp and you have Gorgons than you can go for them. Upgrading your Gnolls might also be good - speed 6 and they hit hard, you can hope to take 1 stack of Medusas out fast.

## STRONGHOLD
Also not recommended, Behemoths can get into speed troubles (Cure would be very helpful but you have only 6% probability to get it in Stronghold's Mage Guild) and you don't want to loose your Rocs. Stronghold hardly needs the money bad, Sulfur you don't need anyway.

If you want to try it, you need a good Goblin force. Usually you don't want to split your Behemoths – if some of them get stoned the lonely Behemoth will die.

## INFERNO
Good town to do it if you have Pit Fiends, coupled with Efreets they hit hard and fast. A large stack of Imps helps of course, but you really need at least 4 Efreets and 7 Pit Fiends to try it, or else 40 Medusas will RIP you. Bring a stack of some Hell Hounds for a blocker that lasts a bit longer than a single Imp.

## NECROPOLIS
Vampire Lords make it a breeze. Without them you can do it with Haste and a bunch of Skeletons, but you don't have any fast hometown blockers so you will need luck with your Tavern heroes. It is not recommended to take the Liches with you.

## DUNGEON
Troglodytes, Harpy blockers and a strong Minotaur force will easily beat 40 Medusas. If you went for Manticores you can get into troubles because they don't deal enough damage. Hasted Troglodytes are extremely powerful.
---
# NAGA BANK

In general, venturing here without Mass Slow is a bad idea. If possible, try to eliminate the morale threat as well.

# DWARVEN TREASURY

# IMP CACHE

# DRAGON UTOPIA

There are 4 kinds of Dragon Utopias, depending on the number of Dragons:

Blacks/Golds/Reds/Greens
1/2/5/8
2/3/6/8
3/4/6/8
5/6/7/8

So, if you see the message:
'Dragon Utopia guarded by pack of creatures: ...'
It's either the 1st or the 2nd; it's not possible to pin point which is it without entering.
If it's a Utopia guarded by lots of creatures, but only a few Blacks it is a 3rd one.
If having several of all it's a full Utopia.

# GENERAL

It is possible to take a full Utopia with shooters (Grand Elves), or appropriate level 7 flyer (Archangels, Archdevils) very early if accompanied by Force Field spell (costs 12) and sufficient mana. It is very helpful to have Earth magic to reduce the cost by 3, and Magi in army would be great to reduce it by further 2. Archery and Offense skills, Haste, Cure and Shield (e.g. for Archangels), Ammo Cart (e.g. for Grand Elves, a must), Bless or Bloodlust (e.g. for Archdevils) are all very welcome. Depending on the Utopia and your troops, you may need anywhere from 40 to 200 mana.
If you don't have Advanced Earth you will have 2-hex Force Field, not enough to protect a 2-hex unit.

# CASTLE

You can take even a full Utopia with 7 Archangels, but you will need Shield and Cure spells. You should start with Shield or Stone Skin and always go for Blacks or Golds turn 1 so that Greens and Reds cannot reach you. Then position yourself in the corner and cure when needed. Your priorities afterwards are Greens and Reds, for they are easier to kill and have higher damage output.
You can also separate the Archangels to 3 + 4 (never less than 3) so that you can resurrect twice. This will work even without Shield, but you will need a good Cure and a good hero (Tazar and Hack would be best). Ideally, you should be able to occupy the greens and reds for a few turns with fodder (so you likely need Mass Haste).

# INFERNO

Archdevils and Force Field can take any Utopia with sufficient mana easily. The ideal hero is Crag Hack.

# DUNGEON AND RAMPART

If you possess Dragons and do not have the speed advantage it is prudent to position your Dragons so that they can only attack your fodder unit in the case the AI decides to strike them. Most of the time these are positions 1, 3 or 6. E.g. if you position them at 3 you should have fodder on 1 and 6.
---
Your goal should always be to avoid the Greens and Reds round 1. This is easy if you have a unit of speed 11 that will survive the potential attack from Golds and Blacks, and Mass Haste. Then you can distract Greens and Reds with your less important units.

## NECROPOLIS

Vampire Lords. Animate Dead, Shield or Counterstrike is all that is needed, considering the size of the Utopia, and the number of Vampires. Armorer specialist is perfect, or Offense specialist if you have Counterstrike.

## GRIFFIN CONSERVATORY

There are four kinds of Griffin Conservatories:

1. guarded by 50 Griffins (provides 1 Angel)
2. guarded by 100 Griffins (provides 2 Angels)
3. guarded by 150 Griffins (provides 3 Angel)
4. guarded by 200 Griffins (provides 4 Angels)

If you see that it's a horde of creatures that is easy to win with a few level 6 and some level 1 units. If you see a throng of creatures you shouldn't attack without 3 level 7 unless you see lots of Royal Griffins and a horde of Griffins: this means it is of 2nd type, and this can be done rather easily as well. If there are no Royals you cannot estimate how many Griffins are there if you do not enter the Conservatory.

## CASTLE

It is possible to take a full Conservatory with 3 Archangels and 6 Pikemen. You need Slow, Shield and Cure and a decent SP and K. There is a possibility to lose 1 Archangel in case of a very unlucky morale of the Griffins.

Marksmen aren't really your best bet for they have equal speed as the Griffins, and are easy target for Royals. If you have the speed advantage (Valeska, artifacts), and, more importantly, fodder faster than the Griffins you can do the Royal-free 1st type immediately, but this is unlikely. In general, you should wait for Cavaliers or Angels.

## DUNGEON

Shakti with upgraded Trogs can easily take out the 1st type, and, if you have Bless, the second type as well. If you fight on neutral terrain no one has the speed advantage.

## STRONGHOLD

Crag Hack can take a full Conservatory w2d1 with 3 Ancient Behemoths, Wolf Raiders, Thunderbirds etc. even without (mass) spells if he has sufficient stats (10 or close in A/D).

## DRAGON FLY HIVE

Main trait of Hives is that you usually do not have initiative. Therefore, if you have Dragons of any sort, it is important to position your troops so that the Flys cannot cause a Firebreath attack against your stack. The pictures show how 1-hex and 2-hex units are positioned in any similar structure.
---
The image shows two battle scenes from a strategy game, likely Heroes of Might and Magic, featuring hexagonal grid battlefields with angelic units positioned on them. Below the images is explanatory text which I'll transcribe as follows:

Notice:
- Dragons cannot be easily deployed without being dangerous for your troops. From position 1 they will endanger 3 and 4, from 2 they will endanger 5, and 4 if its 2-hex etc. So, a good choice could be 4 stacks, 1-hex on 4, and Dragons on 2 - this is the maximum number of stacks you can deploy and avoid friendly Firebreath. If you place the Dragons on 7 they will always be able to strike 5, but 4 only if it's 2-hex, so this can be used too by placing fooder on 5.
- If you deploy fodders on 3, 4, 5 your Firebreath may only hit your fodder.
- Notice what stacks enemy troops can reach based on their speed: not important for Hives, but yes for Crypts, Banks, Treasuries, Caches etc. E.g. Vampires can reach 1, 3, 5 if on neutral, but on dirt they can also reach 4.

## GAME BUGS AND CHEATS

You can enable cheat menu by running the game with X:\...\Heroes.exe /NWCGRAIL command line.
Now, in game press F4 to go to window mode, and you will see the cheat menu.
---
While it's your opponent's turn you can estimate his resources by attempting to buy units, or looking which buildings you (actually he) can build. Also, you can click in the bottom right corner box where you see his flag. You'll see how many towns he has and of what hall type (Village Hall, Town Hall, City Hall, Capitol).

Building a Lighthouse in Castle town increases naval movement of all players' heroes.

Advanced Forgetfulness is a mass spell.

If you attack non upgraded monsters with one upgraded stack, after the retreat, or after you lose, the total amount of creatures will decrease by the number of the upgraded stack. There is no limit to how many times this can be achieved. If abused, this is considered cheating.

The Garden of Life says it increases the weekly growth of Sprite/Pixies by 10 per week but it actually does only by 6.

During your opponent's turn you can right-click on Magic Gardens, Wheels, Magic Shrines (where you can learn spells of level 1, 2, 3) to discover if you opponent was there. If he visited e.g. Magic Shrine level 1 you will be able to read the name of the spell.

If you find a Seer's Hut/Quest Guard etc., which asks you for some creatures (e.g. 5 Hydras) you can revisit the place with exactly the required creatures. By completing the quest your hero becomes a 'ghost hero' – carries no creatures. If you move him into the Garrison and try to get him back out you will see a message: 'This hero has no creatures. A hero must have creatures before he can brave the dangers of the countryside.'

The other, far easier way to accomplish the same is by having two heroes rendezvous: you must get them in such a situation where the future ghost hero has just 1 unit in his army, while the other hero may have any number of units, but they must be in a single stack. Then split the 1 unit into any unoccupied slot of the other hero - it will transfer there.

Using ghost heroes could (will) be considered cheating (although it seems the game designers predicted it).

Ghost heroes have 1900 movement points (speed 9 unit) but do suffer terrain penalty. If playing random maps where towns are placed on native terrain they mostly become useless for towns whose native terrain has penalty associated (Tower and Fortress the most), and incredibly useful for towns whose native terrain has no movement penalty (Castle, Rampart, etc.).

Ghost hero will disappear as soon as he engages in combat.

If you play almost any popular random template and see dirt road instead of a cobblestone road it usually means that the map is bugged, and restart is necessary.

When selling artifacts position the artifact for which you can gain the highest possible money amount on the far right side, and select gold (or any other resource). Now, scroll right and you will see that the price will remain unchanged, while the artifact being sold is now another. This is a game bug, is considered cheating.

Armorer skill and Air Shield increase (approx. double) the damage you receive from town's Turrets, instead of reducing.

By using Fly spell or Angel Wings it is possible to enter any blocked town by pressing SPACE when the hero is moving over the town. In case it is guarded by heroless troops your hero will fight his copy (artifacts and army are cloned as well, you will get the units from the town added to your army and
---
the defenders will get your strongest units. In case that you do not have enough slots for all defending stacks only the strongest will join you). No matter if you win or lose the battle you will lose your hero, but he will immidatelly be avialable for purchase at the Tavern, and will have higher experience based on combat results (HP destroyed). Also, the city will become yours.

## ADMIRAL'S HAT MOVEMENT INCREASE

L0 - hero's total land movement points. Depends on the speed of the slowest unit, Logistics (and specialty), land movement artifacts, and Stables bonus. Adjusts automatically during turn if mentioned factors change.

N0 - hero's total naval movement points. Calculated as 3000 + 750 * Navigation level, plus specialty and Lighthouses, if any. Adjusts automatically during turn if mentioned factors change.

L - current land movement points

N - current naval movement points

m - movement cost, 100 for straight and 141 for diagonal movement

When hero embarkes on a boat his land movement points are translated into naval movement points as such:
N = (L - m) * N0/L0

When hero disembarkes a boat his naval movement points are translated into land movement points as such:
L = (N - m) * L0/N0

Since N, L and m cannot be influenced, one should notice that the only important factors are L0 and N0.

When hero embarkes on a boat he will want his N0 to be as high as possible, and L0 as low as possible. Therefore, he should equip the slowest unit and unequip movement artifacts.

The opposite is when hero disembarkes a boat: he will want his L0 to be as high as possible, and N0 as low as possible.

Example: a hero started the turn with Archangel only (so L0 = 3500). He has Expert Logistics, Expert Navigation, Boots of Speed, Equistrain Gloves, Admiral's Hat, Archangel and a Zombie in army, 2000 land movement points left. He embarks a boat in two ways (straight embarking both):

1) land movement artifacts equiped, only Archangel in army. His naval movement points will be:
N = (2000 - 100) * 5250/3500 = 2850

2) artifacts unequiped, only Zombie in army:
N = (2000 - 100) * 5250/1950 = 5115

As you can see, it is a huge difference. But it is not over - now the hero from case 2) disembarkes the boat, but prior equipes his arts, and returns the Archangel. His land movement points become:
L = (5115 - 100) * 3500/5250 = 3343

By embarking and disembarking a boat under right conditions a hero has gained 3343 - 2000 = 1343 extra movement points. This can be even more radical for Navigation and Logistics specialists. Notice that there is no limit to doing this, except turn duration possibly.

Peculiarity: land map objects that increase movement will increase L, but they will also, undesirably, increase L0: this can be prevented by opening hero screen after visit, for then the recalculation is made, and L0 is not affected, therefore allowing higher naval movement when embarking the boat.

## GRAIL IN ONE DAY
---
When the game checks wether the hero is capable of digging the Grail, it actually checks to see that he has full movement points compared to the slowest unit he is currently carrying. By using a simple calculation it is possible to move and dig for the Grail in the same day.

Example: a hero starts with 1 Archangel, no Logistics, so has L₀ = 2000 movement points. If you give that hero a Zombie, you will set L₀ = 1500. This means that the hero may move 5 straight tiles on non penalty terrain, and then dig for the Grail. Mind, it is not possible to dig if you have 1500 < x < 2000 movement points: you must have the exact number as you would have on the beginning of the next turn based on your slowest unit.
