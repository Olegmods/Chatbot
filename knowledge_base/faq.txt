FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ) **This article has been verified for VCMI 1.5.7 (release date August 26th, 2024)   QUESTION: Again, what is VCMI? ANSWER: In simple words: Remake of Heroes of Might and Magic 3. We use original Heroes 3 graphic, sound and text assets to create a new game that is supposed to work 100% same as H3. Everything in VCMI is made from scratch - loading game files, drawing graphics, AI, game mechanics etc. We have a plan to support popular features from HotA, WoG and HD mod as well as some brand-new features, but there are many other areas that need our attention as well.   QUESTION: What is the purpose of VCMI? Why to play or develop it if Heroes 3 is already there? ANSWER: Our goal is to make “better” heroes 3 that overcomes various H3 engine limitations and allows way easier extensibility / modding than the original game. Also VCMI is cross-platform, so it works on multiple systems such as Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS and Android.   QUESTION: Is HotA / WoG compatible with VCMI? ANSWER: HotA and WoG are mods that work with original Heroes 3, VCMI is basically a new game. Still, they were ported by enthusiasts as VCMI mods, offering limited range of their features. When more VCMI features come, they may be used to re-implement missing parts of mods. For example VCMI scripting (planned future feature) while not being WoG focused work, will be a replacement for WoG’s scripting feature.   QUESTION: Is HD Mod compatible with VCMI? ANSWER: HD Mod is not designed for VCMI. VCMI provides its own options for high resolutions and quality-of-life GUI improvements, some of them being a re-make of HD Mod features. More of them will come as the project evolves.   QUESTION: Where to get latest version? ANSWER: We recommend downloading latest release from https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi/releases/latest - scroll to the bottom and download installer from your system. For Android recommended installation is from Google Play at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=is.xyz.vcmi   QUESTION: How do I install VCMI (Windows)? ANSWER: Easiest way: Download release from https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi/releases/latest and install VCMI into Heroes 3 folder. Cleaner way: Download release and install VCMI into new folder, then when Laucher prompts for Heroes III data files select location of your Heroes III installation.   QUESTION: Who works on this? ANSWER: Volunteers in their free time. VCMI is a non-profit project. Unlike most other Heroes 3 related projects VCMI is open-source, which means it is public and everybody can contribute. That also means project future doesn’t depend on “team members” abandoning it or deciding not to publish source code.   QUESTION: Can I donate? ANSWER: No, at the moment we do not accept donations. There are some ideas for them that are discussed here: https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi/issues/3795   QUESTION: Where do I report bugs? ANSWER: Report bugs on https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi/issues, we strongly recommend using English language.   QUESTION: How do I contact you? ANSWER: We recommend using our Discord server and our forums. If you are not comfortable with English language - we also have language-specific channels on our social platforms.   QUESTION: I like VCMI, how can I help to make it better? ANSWER: It would be best if you could join our Discord server or our Slack. We need C++ developers, QA/testing helpers and native mobile developers for improving mobile ports. There are also other areas, such as graphical design and content management, where we could use some help. You can also create mods with extra content to increase popularity of VCMI platform.   QUESTION: Is VCMI Mod Design Team (MDT) part of VCMI Team? ANSWER: No, they are a separate group of modders and most of them work on the other project (Day of Reckoning) now.   QUESTION: When is VCMI final / 2.0 / whatever version going to be released? ANSWER: Open source projects never stop growing, and they tend to drift in different directions over years. As long as contributors like to add new features, VCMI will continue to evolve. There’s no point in waiting for a “final” version. It’s hard to estimate any sort of big milestones like “100% original H3 compatibility” since work on VCMI is distributed between fixing bugs, adding missing features, developing AI, creating new features that do not exist in Heroes 3 etc. We are not very close to getting rid of every single bug and having every single missing feature implemented, but if VCMI was just about that then we would probably finish long ago. Extensibility of VCMI engine requires doing various things “better” than original Heroes 3 developers did, and not just the easiest way. Engine is built with extensibility in mind, and various mechanics (such as creature abilities) are not hardcoded, but moddable. Our long-term goals, such as improved multiplayer, make VCMI harder to develop in short term.   QUESTION: When is the feature X going to be released? ANSWER: If the feature you wait is on our issues list then you can use emote to upvote it, if not - report it so we know that feature we might be not aware about what is wanted. Everybody has different expectations and priorities. We also have our own idea on what should be higher priority and what not, based on various factors, including temporary state of project. We do not have any page with “what is currently being made” etc. simply, because such pages would quickly become outdated. This might be true for some already existing pages, such as our Wiki.   QUESTION: When will it be possible to play online in multiplayer? ANSWER: As of VCMI 1.5.0, multiplayer has reached a reasonable level of stability and is playable, including support for simultaneous turns and turn timers. There is a lobby to play online with anyone in the world, which can be accessed from within the game: New Game -> Multiplayer -> Online Service (second button from the top). Alternatively, you can play over a local network using any supported device. Further development of multiplayer is definitely on our priority list.   QUESTION: How close is VCMI emulating H3 gameplay? ANSWER: VCMI follows original Heroes 3 mechanics as close as possible and should be fully compatible with it. However, some obvious bugs were fixed, while some features were made optional. The AI is brand new and completely different.   QUESTION: What are the options to customize AI? ANSWER: As of VCMI 1.5.0, the default adventure map AI algorithm is Nullkiller AI (NKAI). It should be fairly challenging, however it may work slowly on low-end devices. There is an alternative faster but simpler VCAI, which you can choose in VCMI launcher settings. You may also check the Boost AI or Extreme AI mod, which provides options to boost AI and to speed it up. In VCMI 1.6 the AI is going be updated.   QUESTION: Are there any WoG options in the WoG mod? ANSWER: In VCMI there is no WoG options. There are submods for WoG with WoG objects that don't require any WoGifying. Also, some other WoG features are replicated in the WoG submods, like 8th level creatures, stack experience and commanders.   QUESTION: Why is my text on another language? ANSWER: Check if you have downloaded the translation you need. If it's downloaded, you should check if Erathian Fonts mod is enabled, then disable it.   QUESTION: Where are popular templates, like Jebus Outcast? ANSWER: These templates aren't implemented in VCMI as of VCMI 1.5.7 and HotA templates aren't supported in VCMI.   QUESTION: I have installed HotA mod, can I play with Factory? ANSWER: HotA Factory will be added with VCMI 1.6. You either can download a develop version to play with HotA Factory (https://builds.vcmi.download/branch/develop/) or play with the custom-made Factory for 1.5.
